The goal of this this school project was to create a priorityque that uses inorder traversal to keep the data sorted from lowest to highest. The data collected are
priority numbers and data that can vary from strings to other intergers. In this case the lowest number has the highest priority. A binary tree is created to store the data with
the priority.
